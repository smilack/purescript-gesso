## Quick Start/Tutorials

The [Quick-Start Guide](https://github.com/smilack/purescript-gesso/blob/master/docs/tutorials/quick-start.md) will walk you through the process of setting up and compiling your first Gesso application. It covers:

* Basic Gesso component configuration
* Running your application with Parcel

These tutorials pick up from the end of the Quick-Start Guide and teach foundational concepts:
