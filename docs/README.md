## Quick Start/Tutorials

The [Quick-Start Guide](quick-start.md) will walk you through the process of setting up and compiling your first Gesso application. It covers:

* Installing Gesso with [Spago](https://github.com/purescript/spago)
* Necessary imports
* How to write your `main` function
* Basic Gesso component configuration
* Running your application with Parcel

These tutorials pick up from the end of the Quick-Start Guide and teach foundational concepts:

1. [Bouncing Ball Tutorial](bouncing-ball.md) - Make a circle move around the screen. Introduces:
  * Drawing
  * Maintaining and updating state
2. [Controlling the Ball Tutorial](controlling-the-ball.md) - Control the ball using the arrow keys or mouse. Introduces event handling.

This tutorial is a little more advanced and covers using a Gesso component in a Halogen application:

3. [Paint App Tutorial](paint-app.md) - A simple drawing app with undo and redo features. Introduces:
  * Component I/O with Halogen queries
